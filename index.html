    <h1>Waiting on Specs : October 19</h1>
    <p>As SpaceX takes in requests for how they will build the test track, we wait for a release on more info. In the meanwhile, the many-man physics department is doing individual run-downs on <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-aeronautical-engineering-delftx-ae1110x-0">aeronautical engineering</a>.</p>
