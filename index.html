    <h1>Let's get down to business / to obtain / the quotes: October 31</h1>
    <p>One would imagine you could just design something and have it immediately exist. Since that doesn't happen, we'll need to get cost estimates for our materials and parts, one email at a time.</p>

    <h1>There are no brakes on this hype train loop: October 31</h1>
    <p>Drafting a CAD model of braking mechanisms. Stopping a large can going several hundred kilometers per hour is not a low-force thing. </p>

    <p>Look at this circle with lines all over it. This is a Hyperloop tube cross-section in two dimensions. This blueprint means the playing field is known. Team members: find the official PDFs in the <a href="http://nyushyperloop.slack.com">Slack</a>.</p>

    <h1>Waiting on Specs : October 19</h1>
    <p>As SpaceX takes in requests for how they will build the test track, we wait for a release on more info. In the meanwhile, the many-man physics department is doing individual run-downs on <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-aeronautical-engineering-delftx-ae1110x-0">aeronautical engineering</a>.</p>
